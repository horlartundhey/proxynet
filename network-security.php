                                <p>IPSec is a proven technology that dramatically diminishes the impact and occurrences of network vulnerabilities. IP Security (IPSec) defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), is the accepted standard for protecting data in transit over an untrusted network and provides 3 levels of security.</p>

                                <p>Confidentiality - keep your data private (IPSec uses industry standard encryption algorithms AES and 3DES to keep data secret). Authentication - Trust your sources Verify the identity of the peer IPSec gateway to verify the source of the data. Integrity - Trust your data IPSec uses industry standard hashing algorithms (SHAI and MD5) to ensure data has not been altered in transit. Proxynet implements IPSec for companies that wants integrity, confidentiality and origin authentication of their life force (data).</p>

                                <h2>Storage and Disaster Recovery Solutions</h2>
                                <p>Proxynet recognizes that the exponential growth of corporate data is one of the largest challenges for which companies must plan. The explosive growth in data that must be stored presents businesses with many distinct challenges. One of these challenges is right-sizing environments – that is, placing data on the right type of storage medium that balances the need for performance and cost of the investment.</p>

                                <p>Proxynet's certified engineers will assist you in evaluating your infrastructure, help plan for future projects, or become part of a virtual team on your next deployment. Proxynet strives very hard to bring you choices in best-of-breed services. At Proxynet, we combine our knowledge of best practices with our years of extensive experience designing unique, custom environments for our clients.</p>

                                <p>Planning for the inevitability of data growth presents challenges in your company's ability to scale and anticipate future upgrade paths. Early planning, and competent and realistic sizing of solutions, ensure a solution that will last its expected lifespan. Otherwise, unexpected growth -- and the ability to adjust scale to fit that growth -- can create challenges that could shorten the expected useful life of storage.</p>

                                <p>In addition to managing data growth comes the need to ably manage that data. At a minimum, businesses must consider the amount of labor and the complexity of adding additional storage to an existing array, and the infrastructure that the new storage will consume.</p>

                                <p>We help ensure that valuable data is protected in the event of a catastrophe. We can also conduct regular tests - before, during and after implementation - to ensure that you have the means to recover quickly and efficiently</p>

                                <h2>Data Storage Backup Tools</h2>
                                <h3>Archiving and Backup</h3>
                                <p>Archiving and Backup are often thought of interchangeably, but there are significant differences between the two. Data Archiving involves the moving inactive data to a separate data storage device for long-term data retention. Data Backups are copies of data preserved in case the original data is lost or destroyed. This is why Data Archiving systems typically free up primary data storage space, reducing overall data storage costs.</p>

                                <h3>Backup and Recovery Software</h3>
                                <p>Backup and Recovery Software has evolved in recent years from simply making copies of your data to now include a whole host of functions. Technologies such as Data Deduplication, Replication, Continuous Data Protection (CDP), Backup Reporting tools, Snapshots, and Data Archiving are now often completely integrated with enterprise-class backup software applications</p>

                                <h3>Cloud Backup</h3>
                                <p>Moving copies of your data completely to an off-site server via a proprietary or public network is known as Cloud Backup, also referred to as Online Backup. The off-site server is typically hosted by a third-party service provider, who charges your company fees based on the capacity required, bandwidth, or even number of users. These firms may offer proprietary off-site servers dedicated only to your data, but the chargeback method operates in a similar fashion.</p>

                                <p>A Cloud Backup system is usually constructed around a Client Software Application (CSA) running on a schedule dictated by what level of service the client purchases. The CSA of a firm that purchases daily backups will collect, compress, encrypt and transfer the data to the service provider's servers every 24 hours. In an effort to reduce bandwidth consumption and the time needed to transfer data, some service providers may only perform incremental backups after an initial full backup at the commencement of services.</p>

                                <p>In the enterprise environment, Cloud Backup services are typically utilized for archiving non-critical data. For companies in this position, with critical data requiring short recovery time objectives (RTO), traditional backup is a better solution due to the physical limits of how much data it is possible to move in a given amount of time over a network.</p>

                                <p>Often, when a large amount of data needs to be recovered via Cloud Backup, the provider may have to ship the recovered material on tape or some other portable storage media.</p>

                                <h3>Virtual Server Backup</h3>

                                <p>Virtual Server Backup refers to the copying of data stored on a virtual server as a safeguard against data loss.</p>

                                <p>Conventional backup software is able to accomplish Virtual Server Backups, but the backup software must be installed on each virtual machine, and backups run to any conventional backup target. Although this is the most straightforward backup approach, it potentially leads to something called Resource Contention, which refers to the fact that the additional resources needed to execute a backup may compromise the performance of the virtual machines on the physical server this is being backed up. Also, a backup software license is required for each virtual machine that will be backed up.</p>

                                <p>Resource Contention is easily addressed via virtualization-specific backup products that directly interface with the virtualization platform, capturing the entire virtual machine's state with point-in-time snapshots. While this allows for fast and complete restoration of a virtual machine, most backup products necessitate the restoration of the entire snapshot, even if just a single file is lost or corrupted. Developers are working on virtual server backup tools that will allow file-level restoration.</p>

                                <p>Proxynet's certified in-house engineers will assess your systems, desktops, and applications, then translate that information into the appropriate Data Storage Backup Tools that suit your business's specialized needs, providing you the highest return on your investment. We will successfully deploy Data Storage Backup Tools that deliver proven solutions that are exactly right for your business.</p>

                                <h3>Disk-Based Backup</h3>
                                <p>Disk-Based Backup systems and Tape-Based Backup systems offer both advantages -- and drawbacks. For many of the typical business-critical computer applications, it's vital that backup data is immediately available when the primary disk becomes inaccessible. Under these circumstances, the time required to restore data from tape would cause unacceptable delays. Disk Backup is the superior solution since data transfer is as much as four to five times more expedient than is possible with Tape Backup. On the other hand, archiving data that needs to be stored indefinitely is more economical using Tape Backup. In addition, tape is portable, making it a good choice for off-site storage.</p>

                                <p>Disk-to-Disk-to-Tape (D2D2T) is a hybrid approach in which data is initially copied to backup storage on a disk storage system, and then periodically copied again to a tape storage system.</p>

                                <p>A D2D2T system offers businesses the best of both backup solutions. System administrators can automate daily backups to disk, allowing for fast restores when critical, and then move the data to tape when it is determined that it is no longer necessary to have it instantaneously accessible. Tape Backup is also utilized to move more mature data offsite for disaster recovery protection, and helps businesses inexpensively comply with regulatory policies for long-term data retention.</p>

                                <p>D2D2T is a component of an overall Storage Virtualization System utilized by storage administrators to meet a company's needs for storage policies without being locked into creating backup strategies based just on the physical devices used.</p>

                                <p>Proxynet's certified in-house engineers will assess your firm's backup needs, and your current systems and policies, then translate that information into the appropriate Data Storage Backup Tools that suit your business's specialized needs. We will successfully deploy the best Data Storage Backup Tools that deliver solid, proven solutions that are tailored to your business's unique needs.</p>


                            <h3>Tape Backup and Libraries</h3>

                            <p>Storing your data on tape is considerably less expensive than the cost of hard disk storage. A Tape Drive Backup offers large amounts of capacity for storing data economically, ranging from a few hundred kilobytes to several gigabytes.</p>

                            <p>In data storage, a Tape Library is simply a collection of magnetic tape cartridges and tape drives. An automated Tape Library is a piece of hardware containing multiple tape drives for reading and writing data, multiple ports for entering and removing tapes, and a robotic device that will mount and dismount the tape cartridges without human intervention, an additional savings.</p>
