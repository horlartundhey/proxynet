                                Systems integration is the process of bringing together the component subsystems into one system and ensuring that the subsystems function together as a system. It links together different computing systems and software applications physically or functionally, to act as a coordinated whole.
                                </p>

                                The systems integrator brings together discrete systems utilizing a variety of techniques such as computer networking, enterprise application integration, business process management or manual programming.

                                <p>
                                More companies are extending the reach of their networks and providing remote access to company data. Proxynet can implement a VPN solution allowing employees to work away from the office and still maintain the security of the office.

                                <p>ProSkool School Management Software enables seamless and defined access to school information and records locally and online. You do not need internet to enjoy multiple, simultaneous access in the school provided the systems are networked.</p>

                                <h3>Virtual Local Area Networks (VLAN)</h3>

                                VLANs is a logical grouping of users and resources connected to administratively defined port on a switch. Proxynet can create VLANs for companies to give them the ability of creating smaller broadcast domains within layer 2 switched internetwork by arranging different ports on the switch to different ports on the subnet.
                                </p>

                                <p>With a VLAN implemented, companies can be able to select staff they want to be on the same VLAN. This will make your switched network to be more secure and data confidentiality will be at the maximum.</p>
